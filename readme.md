This is a mini project to run codes locally on web browsers as during contest the online server
of codeforces is too slow. (using Django... u need it if you wanna use this just run "python manage.py runserver" from terminal in working directory
and it will start localserver)


# Online Judge
This is a local custom test system built with Django.
